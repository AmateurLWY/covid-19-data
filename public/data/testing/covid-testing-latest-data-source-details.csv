In some early reports, the testing figures' units are unclear because the same testing figures refer to both the number of cases tested and the number of tests performed; later reports are standardised and testing figures consistently refer to the number of tests performed, so we assume that the discrepancy is due to ambiguous language and translation issues.

Testing figures refer to PCR and antigen tests. Antigen tests were first reported in Albania on [8 December 2020](https://shendetesia.gov.al/covid19-ministria-e-shendetesise-2532-testime-347-te-sheruar-753-raste-te-reja-dhe-14-humbje-jete-ne-24-oret-e-fundit/). Serological tests are also performed in Albania for ""screening purposes"" (""për arsye depistimi""), meaning that positive results are not used to confirm cases of COVID-19, and so they are excluded from our testing figures to ensure the accuracy of our Positive Rate. In reports from 10 Nov to 6 Dec 2020, testing figures refer to the total number of tests, and specifcy the number of which that are 'for screening purposes'; in such instances, we report the difference between these two figures in order to exclude serological tests. As such, our cumulative total differs that from the total tests ('Testime totale') reported by the source.

Because of this, the cumulative number of tests went from 3,919,571 on 11 January to 6,865,442 on 12 January. More similar additions were made later in January.

The definition of the tests in this dataset was changed on 13 January 2021 to include both antigen and PCR tests. Because historical testing data was added on that date, the timeline cannot be used for continuous calculations. Like most Austrian media outlets and scientific institutions, we have therefore changed our test positive rate calculations to only include data from February 2021 onwards.

Austria has been testing at a high rate: both PCR and antigen tests are available for free, regardless of COVID symptoms, and testing is compulsory for school children and for accessing many services. Due to this very high number of tests in the denominator, this results in a positive rate that is very low."

— The number of cases reported for Belgium only includes cases confirmed by a positive PCR test.
— The number of tests reported by Sciensano in its time series of tests performed includes both PCR and antigen tests.

As such, we conclude that a positive result from a PCR test is necessary to diagnose cases of COVID-19 and that testing figures refer to PCR tests.

Recent daily briefs consistently report testing figures in terms of the cumulative number of tests (""pruebas"") performed. However, in the initial months of the COVID-19 outbreak, the daily briefs previously reported testing figures using inconsistent terminology such as samples (“muestras”) tested, people who have undergone tests (”personas, que fueron sometidas a pruebas”), and tests (""pruebas"") performed. It does not appear that this inconsistent use of terminology reflects a substantive change in the reported figures, since there are no corresponding large breaks in the time series.

In 10 briefs, the number of negative tests was not reported, preventing us from calculating a total for that date. For these dates with missing official data, we use data provided in this [unofficial GitHub repository](https://github.com/mauforonda/covid19-bolivia), which we have cross-referenced against the official data for all dates.

The national figure is calculated by aggregating testing figures from each state. 

Note that counting methods and test definitions vary across Brazilian states, and so calculating an accurate positive rate for the entire country can be very challenging (see this [blog post](https://covidtracking.com/analysis-updates/test-positivity-in-the-us-is-a-mess) summarizing the analogous problem in the US). Nonetheless, all states' testing figures refer to 'testes aplicados' or 'testes realizados', and so it appears the units are consistent; furthermore, while some states include seroligical tests in their testing figures, while others do not, it appears the test definition is consistent with the case definition for each state. As such, our estimate of the positive rate is equal to the 7-day average of cases divided by the 7-day average of all reported tests performed across the country."

Data is available from 6 March 2020.

Prior to 24 July 2020, suspected COVID-19 cases in Costa Rica could only be confirmed via a positive PCR test result, as described in the 12 June 2020 national [guidelines](https://www.ministeriodesalud.go.cr/sobre_ministerio/prensa/docs/lineamientos_nacionales_vigilancia_infeccion_coronavirus_12062020_v14_vf.pdf) for COVID-19 surveillance. However, revised [guidelines](https://www.ministeriodesalud.go.cr/sobre_ministerio/prensa/docs/lineamientos_nacionales_vigilancia_infeccion_coronavirus_v15_24072020.pdf) published on 24 July 2020 expand the definition of a confirmed COVID-19 case to allow for cases to be confirmed without a PCR test, by epidemiological link.

In the dataset, ""nue_posi"" refers to ""daily positive cases"" (""Nuevos casos diarios positivos por COVID-19""), ""conf_nexo"" refers to ""daily positive cases confirmed by epidemiological link"" (""Nuevos casos diarios positivos por COVID-19 confirmados por nexo epidemiológico""), and ""nue_descar"" refers to ""daily cases whose laboratory tests were negative"" (""Nuevos casos diarios cuyos exámenes de laboratorio dieron negativo""). We subtract ""conf_nexo"" from ""nue_posi"" to determine the number of daily cases confirmed by a positive laboratory test. We then add this value to ""nue_descar"" to determine the total number of daily people tested by PCR test. We also estimate the Positive Rate by dividing the 7-day average of daily cases confirmed by a positive PCR test by the 7-day average of daily people tested by PCR test.

On 29 Jan 2021, ""the Ministry of Health endorsed the acquisition and use of antigen tests"" in 10 laboratories, according to [this article](https://www.ministeriodesalud.go.cr/index.php/centro-de-prensa/noticias/746-noticias-2021/2042-laboratorios-con-aval-de-salud-para-realizar-pruebas-de-antigeno-de-sars-cov-2?fbclid=IwAR3c0c_YI28AnSjIsCdP1kOczUcE_cVYghZ9c7SjRFauCSQ540eIjkddzPE). We will monitor the situation to determine if these antigen tests are included in testing and case figures.

It is unclear whether the reported figures include tests for which the results are pending.

Prior to 24 March 2020, testing figures were reported in terms of ""samples tested"" (e.g. ""Ukupno je 317 testiranih uzoraka...""). From 24 March to 6 May 2020, testing figures were reported in terms of ""tests performed"" (e.g. ""Dosad je obavljeno ukupno 3.159 testiranja""). Since 6 May 2020 they have been reported in terms of ""people tested"" (e.g. ""Dosad je testirano ukupno 41.053 osoba""). It does not appear that this change in terminology reflects a substantive change in the figures that are reported, however, since there were no large breaks in the time series coinciding with these changes in terminology.

On 1 November 2020, the Minister of Health announced in a [press release](https://vlada.gov.hr/vijesti/beros-od-utorka-brzi-antigenski-testovi-uskoro-novo-serolosko-testiranje/30740) that antigen and antibody tests will be used ""to determine how many people in Croatia were in contact with the virus"". However, it is unclear if antigen and antibody tests will be included in testing figures, or if positive results from these tests will be included in confirmed case figures.

The source provides data for both the cumulative number of people tested to date and the number of people tested in the last 24 hours. The daily change in the cumulative number of people tested to date equals the number of people tested in the last 24 hours, suggesting that the cumulative total will repeatedly count people that have undergone more than one round of testing over the course of the pandemic. However no further details were found at either source.

We have found testing data dating back to 3 March 2020, at which point 247 samples had been tested to date.

Testing figures refer to the number of PCR tests, according to our [source](https://covid19cubadata.github.io/#cuba). This is corroborated by the fact that the number of cases is equal to the number of positive test results reported by the [Ministry of Health](https://salud.msp.gob.cu/category/covid-19/).

The context in which the figures are published suggests that the number of tests performed may be equivalent to the number of individuals tested.

We calculate the daily number of tests performed based on the sum of ""pocet_PCR_testy"" (PCR tests) and ""pocet_AG_testy"" (antigen tests).

We also calculate a positive rate by dividing the 7-day sum of positive results (""incidence_pozitivni"") by the 7-day sum of tests performed. This positive rate is calculated based on PCR and antigen tests (rather than only PCR) because our source for confirmed cases (Johns Hopkins University) includes the positive results of antigen tests in the count of daily confirmed cases in Czechia. The results of our positive rate will therefore be different from the graph shown on the [official dashboard](https://onemocneni-aktualne.mzcr.cz/covid-19) since the latter is based on PCR tests alone.

An adjustment of the duplicate testing methods for patients benefiting from repeated testing during the pandemic (and therefore of the definition of ""tested persons"") has also been made. These changes have no impact on the trends and interpretation of the dynamics of the epidemic, which remain the same.
Previously, negative multi-testers were excluded, with the result that the number of people tested was increasingly underestimated over time. The positive rates were very close regardless of the method of calculation used until the week of August 9, when a gap began to appear, due to the very large number of tests performed and the exclusion of the multi-tested negative persons.

This update states on page 4 that ‘antigen tests can, under certain conditions, be a useful addition to the PCR test. Antigen tests thus contribute to the further expansion of test capacity’. A [daily status report](https://www.rki.de/DE/Content/InfAZ/N/Neuartiges_Coronavirus/Situationsberichte/Dez_2020/2020-12-02-de.pdf?__blob=publicationFile) from 2 December 2020 notes, 'this can have the consequence that the population of the tested persons differs from that of the previous weeks’, as antigen tests are used instead of PCR tests in certain scenarios, which may cause the positive rate to increase. ‘Therefore the positive rates of the previous weeks are not directly comparable with the positive rates from Week 46’. According to [this infographic](https://www.rki.de/SharedDocs/Bilder/InfAZ/neuartiges_Coronavirus/Teststrategie.png?__blob=poster&v=8) from 23 November 2020, positive results from antigen tests must be confirmed with a PCR test, and so they are not included in reported case figures.

Ghana's Outbreak Response Management provides [daily situation updates](https://www.ghanahealthservice.org/covid19/archive.php) reporting the total number of samples tested; this was our source from 2020-03-17 until 2022-01-10.

Between 10 and 26 May 2020, the daily situation updates provide figures for both the number of samples tested and the number of persons tested. Over this period the two figures differ from one another by exactly 981 tests on each day, which is due to persons under mandatory quarantine undergoing multiple test (2,022 samples tested on 1,041 persons). This discrepancy of 981 tests is small, representing less than 1% of cumulative samples tested at the time. In contrast, the cumulative number of samples tested through routine surveillance and contact tracing are exactly equal to the cumulative number of persons tested on each day in these respective categories. 

Prior to 10 May 2020, the daily situation updates provide testing figures using inconsistent terminology, varying between ""samples tested"", ""persons tested"", ""suspected cases tested"", and similar language. Nevertheless, we choose to include all of these figures within our constructed time series, since the variation in terminology does not appear to correspond to large breaks in the time series. In addition, based on the fact that the number of samples tested differs only slightly from the number of persons tested over the 10 May to 26 May 2020 period, we have no reason to believe that the variation in terminology prior to 10 May has any serious ramifications for the interpretation of the time series as the cumulative number of samples tested. From 10 May 2020 onwards, the daily situation updates consistently report the cumulative number of samples tested. 

No further information is provided about the reported testing numbers, such as whether they include pending or non-PCR tests."

IND,India - samples tested,2022-02-11,https://github.com/datameet/covid19,Indian Council of Medical Research,Made available by DataMeet on GitHub,683,747870047,536.72,1673976,1.201,1723681,1.237,,,Indian Council of Medical Research,https://github.com/datameet/covid19,The number of samples tested.,"The ICMR reports separate figures for both “samples tested” and “people tested” at press conferences and in press releases (shown separately in the charts above). No other details are provided.

The press releases from ICMR do not always stay online for very long. The reason for this is unknown, but the releases are being backed up at this [GitHub repository](https://github.com/datameet/covid19).

On some occasions there appear to have been more than one update released per day. Where we are aware of multiple observations for the day, we show the number for the earlier release.

The ICMR website does not explicitly state whether the reported figures refer to PCR tests only. From contextual information, it appears that the reported figures may also include samples that were tested using a TrueNat non-PCR test. ICMR communications on [21 May 2020](https://www.icmr.gov.in/pdf/press_realease_files/ICMR_Press_Release_TruNat_21052020.pdf) and [19 April 2020](https://www.icmr.gov.in/pdf/covid/labs/Additional_guidance_on_TrueNat_based_COVID19_testing.pdf) indicate that TrueNat tests are being used in diagnostic testing. These TrueNat tests likely account for a small minority of all samples tested.

Several press articles in late 2020 reported that rapid antigen testing accounted for a majority of tests being performed in the country to detect COVID-19. [According to the Hindustan Times](https://www.hindustantimes.com/health/rapid-antigen-tests-account-for-close-to-50-of-covid-19-tests-in-india-govt-data/story-WLh6mbgmXsZ92EBAA3zzBM.html), ""of the 120 million samples tested for Covid-19 [by November 11, 2020], 49% have been done using rapid antigen testing"".

Figures relate to the total number of tests performed. This figure is available for each individual region separately at the source indicated. However it appears that data is missing for individual regions for particular dates – we assume that these are also missing from the aggregate total for Italy that we provide. The list of missing data, in English, can be seen at the bottom of [this data dashboard built by Franco Mossotto](https://datastudio.google.com/u/0/reporting/91350339-2c97-49b5-92b8-965996530f00/page/RdlHB). 

It is clear that there are delays in timeline running up to a test being reported – both in terms of the time it takes for a symptomatic person to receive a test, and in the time for that test to then get reported in the data. For one region, Lombardy, [an investigation](https://arxiv.org/ftp/arxiv/papers/2003/2003.09320.pdf) found the latter delay in the early period of the outbreak to be around 3-4 days.

There is significant variation in testing practices – in terms of how many tests are conducted and how they are allocated across the population – across regions and these practices have also changed over time. The extent to which tests pending results are included appears to vary across regions.

Pietro Monticone and Riccardo Valperga have written a very helpful and detailed description of these data quality issues [here in GitHub](https://pitmonticone.github.io/covid-italy/owid-testing-italy.html).

Since September 2020, the Italian government [has approved the use of antigen tests](http://www.salute.gov.it/portale/nuovocoronavirus/dettaglioNotizieNuovoCoronavirus.jsp?lingua=italiano&menu=notizie&p=dalministero&id=5084) for the rapid diagnosis of COVID-19.

The tweets and press releases usually reported testing figures in terms of the number of ""samples tested"". However, the wording used in some tweets and press releases makes it unclear whether the figures relate to the number of samples tested or the number of people tested. For example, the relevant tweet on [4 June 2020](https://twitter.com/MOH_Kenya/status/1268563481235787776) says ""2,640 samples tested in the last 24 hours"", while the relevant tweet on [1 August 2020](https://twitter.com/MOH_Kenya/status/1289552051916009475) states that ""727 people are the latest to test positive for Covid-19 from a sample of 6,371 tested in the last 24 hrs"". It does not appear that this inconsistency in terminology reflects a substantive change in the figures that are reported, since there are no large breaks in the time series that correspond to the use of ""samples tested"" versus ""people tested"" terminology. Instead, the wording of the tweets and press releases suggests that the reported number of samples tested may be equivalent to the number of people tested. The new source explicitly refers to the number of tests performed, which we use as the unit for the testing figures."

This is because there are individuals who require repeated tests."" It is therefore clear that antigen tests are included in the testing figures, and that positive results can be used to confirm cases of COVID-19.

It is unclear if the cumulative number of people tested repeatedly counts people who have gone through more than one round of testing over the course of the pandemic. Since we derive a count of the daily number of people tested from the change in this cumulative number, if people undergoing multiple rounds of testing are not counted repeatedly in the cumulative testing figures, then they will not appear in our daily testing figures.

""Repeat samples"" are included in the testing figures. The cumulative total is available from [26 June 2020](https://twitter.com/HPA_MV/status/1276561168505737216/photo/1) to 27 Sept 2020. The daily total is available from [28 Sept 2020](https://twitter.com/HPA_MV/status/1310630037381668866/photo/1) until 23 Nov 2020; we determined the cumulative total by summing the daily totals. Both the cumulative and daily totals are available since [24 Nov 2020](https://twitter.com/HPA_MV/status/1320050775872200706); we still determine the cumulative total by summing the daily totals. Note that the sum of daily totals is less that the reported cumulative total, with an average deficit of around 5,500, or about 1%; the cause of this discrepancy is unclear, but appears to be innocuous.

Prior to 26 June 2020, our source was the daily update videos posted to the Maldives Ministry of Health [official Facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/MinistryOfHealthMV), which reported the number of positive, pending, and total “Laboratory Sample[s]” tested toward the end of these videos they report ; before 16 June 2020 the number of negative samples was also reported. The positive, negative, and total numbers are cumulative, while the pending numbers are current as of that day.

From 16–25 June 2020, we used the reported total, which likely includes pending tests. Before 16 June 2020, when negative numbers were reported, we used the total of positive and negative numbers rather than the reported total, since the latter generally included pending values and occasionally contained discrepant numbers that did not match any combination of the positive, negative, or pending numbers. Data is available from [16 March 2020](https://www.facebook.com/561317043971945/videos/2617005481743781/), when 221 samples had been tested.

According to the [case definition](https://covid19.health.gov.mv/updated-case-definitions-for-covid-19/) published 9 Jan 2021, a positive PCR test is necessary to confirm a case of COVID-19. Antigen tests are available but not recommended, and all results should be reported to HPA. It is therefore unclear if antigen tests are included in the number of samples tested; the case definition must match the test definition in order for the Positive Rate to be accurate, and so we exclude our estimate from the dataset."

Since 7 July 2020, the daily situation reports have differentiated between the number of tests performed in the past 24 hours and the number of ""diagnostic"" tests performed in the past 24 hours. For example, the [11 October 2020 situation report](http://www.sante.gov.mr/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/111020-Mauritanie-Sitrep-COVID-19_FR-.pdf) states: ""91 tests performed today including 83 diagnostic tests"" (translated).

To arrive at the time series shown on our website, we use the CSV files for confirmed cases (""confirmados"") and negative cases (""negativos""). For each file, we only keep the row that reports national data, merge the two files together, and add up confirmed and negative cases to find the number of people tested each day. We then calculate the positive rate as the 7-day sum of positive tests divided by the 7-day sum of people tested.

On November 22nd, the Ministry of Health announced in a [press conference](https://www.gob.mx/presidencia/articulos/version-estenografica-conferencia-de-prensa-informe-diario-sobre-coronavirus-covid-19-en-mexico-257772?idiom=es) that antigen tests can now be used to confirm cases of COVID-19.

A [press release](https://www.gob.mx/salud/prensa/188-prueba-diagnostica-de-pcr-garantiza-un-resultado-confiable-de-covid-19?idiom=es) on Nov 5th confirmed that antibody tests are neither used for case confirmation nor included in testing and case figures.

Two pieces of evidence suggest that people undergoing multiple rounds of testing over the course of the pandemic may be counted each round: 1) Figures refer to the number of cases tested, and each case has a unique ID; and 2) The source provides the number of cases with samples tested in the past 24 hours, which matches the daily change in the cumulative number of cases tested.

We construct a time series of the cumulative total number of cases tested to date using updates from the Ministry of Health's official Twitter page ([@Ministere_Sante](https://twitter.com/Ministere_Sante)).

The report states that all antigen tests and positive results must be reported to the Ministry of Health.

The number of positive cases registered and the total number of negative tests is equal to the number of total tests conducted for the majority of the daily reports released. For dates where this is not the case, we favour the sum of positive cases registered and the number of negative tests. From 3 October 2020, the MOH no longer reports the number of negative tests. Instead, it reports the number of tests in the last 24 hours and the cumulative number of tests.

There are reports published prior to the 28 March (the earliest we could find is dated 18 March 2020) that include the number of positive and negative tests conducted by the National Institute of Health or in private laboratories. However, the cumulative totals for 26 and 27 March 2020 are inconsistent with the cumulative total reported for the 28 March 2020 onwards. Therefore, to avoid potential inconsistenies with the series from 28 March 2020, we do not include these testing figures."

The reports also record the number of tests performed (""Aantal testen met uitslag"") during any given week in Table 13 (""Tabel 13: Aantal testen uitgevoerd door de GGD’en, met bekende uitslag""); our testing figures refer to the number of people tested (Tabel 17) because the time series is longer.

Our positive rate reflects the official positive rate recorded in Table 17 of the weekly epidemiological reports.

There appear to be reporting lags in the weekly reports, such that the reported figures for any given week increase over the following weeks; figures are retrospectively revised once a week with the latest figures as labs report additional results. It is unclear if pending tests are included in the testing figures. The testing figures of up to 54 labs within the country are reported in the dataset. Data are available from the week ending 15 March 2020.
 
PCR and antigen tests are both included in testing figures. On 12 October 2020, the Government of the Netherlands published a [document](https://www.rijksoverheid.nl/binaries/rijksoverheid/documenten/kamerstukken/2020/10/14/stand-van-zaken-brief-covid-19/stand-van-zaken-brief-covid-19.pdf), which notes on page 18 that antigen tests ‘can replace the PCR test in certain situations’.These situations are explained in further detail on page 16 of a document providing [Advice on Antigen Testing](https://www.rijksoverheid.nl/binaries/rijksoverheid/documenten/rapporten/2020/10/14/advies-antigeensneltesten/advies-antigeensneltesten.pdf): a PCR test is not required for confirmation of a positive result, but it is for a negative result; te document also states on page 7 that antigen 'test results are recorded in a laboratory information system', and so they are included in the weekly epidemiological reports’ figures.

In February 2021, the governement started using PCR to confirm all antigen tests. For all intents and purposes Slovenia's case definition is therefore defined only by positive PCR results, even if some people are getting screened and found via antigen before they are confirmed with PCR. It thus makes sense to only consider PCR tests in our testing figures and positivity rate — which is also what the government has done in its own communication. 

We use the [lab-tests API endpoint](https://api.sledilnik.org/api/lab-tests) to collect the number of PCR tests performed on a daily basis, from which we construct a time series.

As such, estimates of positive rates based on the number of tests and the number of confirmed cases may be greater than the true figure.

On 12 November 2020, the Ministry of Health published an update of the [Strategy for Early Detection Surveillance and Control of COVID-19](https://www.mscbs.gob.es/profesionales/saludPublica/ccayes/alertasActual/nCov/documentos/COVID19_Estrategia_vigilancia_y_control_e_indicadores.pdf). This update states on page 6 that positive results from both PCR and antigen tests can be used to confirm diagnoses for COVID-19. Furthermore, it states on page 6 that positive results from IgM antibody tests can also be used to confirm active cases of COVID-19, when the clinical criteria for suspected cases are also met; it also states on page 19 that under ‘exceptional’ circumstances, positive results from IgG antibody tests can be used to confirm resolved cases of COVID-19 in asymptomatic patients, but that ‘screening through serological tests is not recommended’; as such, antibody tests are likely to represent only a small fraction of total tests.

Only the latter time series was displayed in the dashboard, yet both time series are available at this [API endpoint](https://services6.arcgis.com/BiTAc9ApDDtL9okN/arcgis/rest/services/COVID19_Table_DATESetTOTAL/FeatureServer/0/query?f=json&where=Dates%3E%272020-01-01+00%3A00%3A00%27&returnGeometry=False&spatialRel=esriSpatialRelIntersects&outFields=Dates%2CNb_test%2CNb_tests_journalier&orderByFields=Dates+asc&resultOffset=0&resultRecordCount=32000&resultType=standard).

According to a [bulltein](https://onmne.tn/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/bulletin-COVID-19-du-15-Janvier-2021-NBA.pdf) published by the ONMNE on 15 Jan 2021, private tests have been included in the dataset since September 2020. Furthermore, as of November 2020, antigen tests have been used to confirm cases of COVID-19, and these tests are also included in the dataset.

The earliest observation is available from 10 March 2020, at which point a total of 150 people had been tested."

We query the API to produce a time series of the cumulative number of tests performed in Uganda.

The Uganda Ministry of Health also publishes a daily press releases on their official Twitter account ([@MinofHealthUG])(""https://twitter.com/MinofHealthUG"") detailing the cumulative and daily number of samples tested, which was our source until 04-02-2022. Data is available from [1 April 2020](https://www.health.go.ug/document/update-on-the-covid-19-outbreak-in-uganda-3/).

According to a [press release](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=&ved=2ahUKEwi-qf-Y3dPuAhWDjlkKHeDWA3gQFjABegQIAxAC&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.health.go.ug%2Fdownload-attachment%2FHm_WTW-rTxIrXNEeBm-h-rhU9IyaxOFwrXyrWhrvIlk%2C&usg=AOvVaw3tavEmv7NIF8koJVYq-EDs) published by the Ministry of Health on 5 June 2020, ""the PCR is the only single, dependable and WHO recommended test used for diagnostic purposes in Uganda"". As such, we conclude that testing and case figures refer to PCR tests.

The earliest press release we could find that lists the cumulative and daily figures is for 1 April 2020. However, we cannot say with certainty when testing began and the precise date from which cumulative totals begin.

According to Oxford University's [Coronavirus Government Response Tracker](https://github.com/OxCGRT/covid-policy-tracker/tree/master/data), government policy currently covers ""testing of anyone showing COVID-19 symptoms""."

It is unclear whether the reported figures include tests pending results.

In the daily snapshots, the wording used to report the cumulative testing figures does not make it clear as to whether the reported figures relate to the number of tests performed or the number of persons tested. For example, the cumulative testing figure reported on 6 August 2020 is ""1,116,641 tested"" (translated from ""протестовано""). The [english version](https://covid19.gov.ua/en) of the same page reports the same figure as ""total of tests"", which is also unclear. [A more detailed dashboard](https://covid19.gov.ua/analitichni-paneli-dashbordy) on the same web domain provides testing figures in downloadable csv files dating back to 1 June 2020, where each csv file contains separate columns for the cumulative number of PCR tests and non-PCR tests. The cumulative PCR testing figures reported in these csv files are described as ""The number of laboratory tests performed by PCR on COVID-19"" (""Кількість проведених лабораторних досліджень методом ПЛР на COVID-19""), making it clear that the figures refer to the number of tests performed (which may or may not be equivalent to the number of people tested).

The cumulative PCR testing figures provided in the csv files tend to be approximately 2% smaller than the testing figures provided in the daily snapshots. Nevertheless, we assume that this discrepancy is due to small differences in the reference date, reporting laboratories included, or other minor details, rather than the possibility that the daily snapshot figures include non-PCR tests or refer to a metric other than the number of tests performed. The cumulative number of non-PCR tests reported in the csv files are much larger than the size of this discrepancy.

The earliest reported figure that we have been able to find is from 9 April 2020, at which point 20,608 cumulative tests were reported.

It ""includes viral COVID-19 laboratory test (PCR) results from over 1,000 U.S. laboratories and testing locations including commercial and reference laboratories, public health laboratories, hospital laboratories, and other testing locations.""

The source notes that ""data presented here is representative of diagnostic specimens being tested - not individual people (...). Data presented might not represent the most current counts for the most recent 3 days due to the time it takes to report testing information. The data may also not include results from all potential testing sites within the jurisdiction (e.g., non-laboratory or point of care test sites) and therefore reflect the majority, but not all, of COVID-19 testing being conducted in the United States.""

It is also explained in the description that the data ""excludes serology tests where possible"", which may indicate that not 100% of the tests included in the time series are PCR tests.

Note that due to the great diversity of counting methods across US states for both cases and tests, calculating an accurate positive rate for the entire country can be very challenging. The volunteer-led COVID Tracking Project has a very useful blog post summarizing these obstacles: '[Test Positivity in the US Is a Mess](https://covidtracking.com/analysis-updates/test-positivity-in-the-us-is-a-mess)'."

To ensure accuracy, we have cross-checked a sample of the dashboard figures against the Ministry of Health and ZNPHI reports.

Official reports from the Ministry of Health and ZNPHI use the terminology ""tests conducted"" and ""samples tested"" interchangeably over time, with no indication that the choice of terminology represents a substantive difference in the reported figures.

The reported figures that are based on ZNPHI reports exclude pending test results, while it is unclear whether the reported figures from the Ministry of Health reports exclude pending test results. Nevertheless, pending test results represent a small fraction of overall tests, so this possible discrepancy is of minor consequence."

We query the API to produce a time series of the cumulative number of tests performed in Zimbabwe.

The Zimbabwe Ministry of Health and Child Care provides daily press releases on its website and Twitter account ([@MoHCCZim](https://twitter.com/MoHCCZim)) that report the cumulative number of tests performed to date, which was our source until 04-02-2022. The reported figures include positive, negative, and pending test results.

The press release for 6 May 2020 reported that 7,808 PCR and 8,244 ""rapid screening"" tests had been conducted to date. We exclude rapid screening tests from the daily time series that we construct, since we assume that these are antibody tests.

Prior to 6 May 2020, the press releases either: (a) reported a combined cumulative total of PCR and rapid screening tests without providing a breakdown between the two types of tests; or (b) did not clearly specify whether the reported cumulative total was in reference to PCR tests, antibody tests, or both. For this reason, the daily time series we construct begins on 6 May 2020, at which point the press releases began to clearly indicate that the reported cumulative totals only include PCR tests.

Since [19 Jan 2021](https://twitter.com/MoHCCZim/status/1351632194033360903/photo/1), the press releases report a combined cumualtive total of PCR and rapid antigen tests. According to a [United Nations report](https://zimbabwe.un.org/en/111012-capacitating-rural-health-facilities-rapid-covid-19-testing), published on 27 January 2021, antigen tests can be used to diagnose cases of COVID-19 in Zimbabwe.

According to footnotes in the [infographics](https://twitter.com/MoHCCZim/status/1436104450909822977) cases can be confirmed without any reported tests in some provinces; this is because not all labs report test results in Zimbabwe: ""provinces with new cases but zero PCR tests conducted respectively received results from NMRL, NTBRL & Pvt Labs""."
