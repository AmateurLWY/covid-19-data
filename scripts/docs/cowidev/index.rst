cowidev
=======
**cowidev** is a python package developed at `Our World in Data <https://ourworldindata.org>`_ to maintain and produce
`our global COVID-19 dataset <https://ourworldindata.org/coronavirus>`_. It contains several tools for all the COVID
data pipelines, including vaccinations and testing. Due to the nature of the problem, this library is in
development and no stable version is expected anytime soon. You can explore all the source code on our `GitHub
repository <https://github.com/owid/covid-19-data>`_.


To explore the library in detail, please refer to `its API documentation <source/api/cowidev.html>`_. Note that this library is in constant change,
and hence the documentation might not be complete or updated for some modules.
