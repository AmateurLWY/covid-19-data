Covid-19
===================================
**cowidev** is a python package developed at `Our World in Data <https://ourworldindata.org>`_ to maintain and produce
`our global COVID-19 dataset <https://ourworldindata.org/coronavirus>`_. It contains several tools for all the COVID
data pipelines, including vaccinations and testing. Due to the nature of the problem, this library is in
development and no stable version is expected anytime soon. You can explore all the source code on our `GitHub
repository <https://github.com/owid/covid-19-data>`_.

Overview
--------
This page explains how we produce the dataset, and which tools we use to this end. In
addition, it details how to properly set up the development environment so that users in the open source comunity can
contribute to improve the project. Finally, it describes the project command tool :code:`cowid`, which is our data
pipeline management tool.
